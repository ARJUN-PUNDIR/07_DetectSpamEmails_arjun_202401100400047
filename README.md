📧 Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

Spam emails are not only annoying but can also be harmful, often serving as a gateway for phishing attacks, scams, or malware. With the increasing volume of emails exchanged every day, automated spam detection has become a crucial component of modern communication systems.

This project demonstrates how machine learning—specifically Logistic Regression—can be used to classify emails as either spam or not spam based on structured metadata (rather than the full email text content). The goal is to build a baseline classification model and evaluate its performance using standard classification metrics.

🔍 Project Objectives
	•	Classify emails using structured numerical and categorical metadata
	•	Implement a Logistic Regression model for binary classification
	•	Measure model effectiveness using:
	•	Accuracy
	•	Precision
	•	Recall
	•	Visualize performance with a Confusion Matrix Heatmap
	•	Serve as a foundational project for future improvements using more advanced algorithms or text-based analysis

📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes multiple features extracted from email metadata, such as:
	•	Sender information (domain, trust score)
	•	Number of links or attachments
	•	Email length
	•	Presence of keywords or flags
	•	And more…

The target column is:
	•	is_spam: Binary value where 1 indicates spam and 0 indicates not spam (ham)

⚙️ Tools and Libraries Used
	•	Python: Core programming language
	•	Pandas: Data loading and manipulation
	•	Scikit-learn: Model training, preprocessing, evaluation metrics
	•	Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization, including the confusion matrix

⸻

🧪 Methodology
	1.	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Load the structured CSV dataset.
	•	Encode the target variable (is_spam) using Label Encoding.
	•	Split data into training and testing subsets (80/20 ratio).
	2.	Model Training:
	•	Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
	3.	Evaluation:
	•	Predict on the test data.
	•	Calculate accuracy, precision, and recall.
	•	Generate a confusion matrix and visualize it using Seaborn heatmap.
 📊 Results (Baseline Performance)
	•	Accuracy: approximately 50%
	•	Precision: approximately 43%
	•	Recall: approximately 33%
🔒 Ethics & Data Privacy

If working with real-world email data:
	•	Always anonymize personal information
	•	Comply with regulations such as GDPR or CCPA
	•	Ensure secure handling of user data
